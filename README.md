## Overview

The desafio_btg_microservicos project is a scalable microservices architecture designed to manage essential business processes such as client management, order processing, product handling, and user authentication. By utilizing technologies like NestJS, PostgreSQL, and RabbitMQ, the project ensures efficient communication and data management across distinct services. Its modular design promotes maintainability, allowing individual services to operate independently while seamlessly integrating to fulfill complex workflows. This architecture enhances operational efficiency and facilitates robust service interactions, ultimately delivering a reliable and high-performance solution for modern application needs.

## Acknowledgments

- I would like to thank the Nest.JS team for their well-written documentation and for developing an excellent framework that made it possible to create my project.
- The inspiration for this project came from a technical challenge from BTG, which I found interesting and developed further with additional features and increased complexity.
- Additionally, this README was created with the assistance of AI using the project found at [README AI](https://hub.docker.com/r/zeroxeli/readme-ai).
